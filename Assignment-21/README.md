# BIO 365 - Assignment 21

### Introduction

The purpose of this assignment is to give you practice coding in R and to help reinforce your understanding of experimental design.

Please go to the `BIO365` Git repository you created for a previous assignment. Create a directory called `Assignment-21`. 

This assignment is based on the Practice Problems at the back of Chapter 14 in the textbook. Please work through the problems listed below. Write down (or type) answers to each of the problems. Then compare your answers against the answers at the back of the book. As needed, re-work the problems until you understand them.

* Practice Problem 1
* Practice Problem 4
* Practice Problem 5
* Practice Problem 6
* Practice Problem 8
* Practice Problem 9
* Practice Problem 11
* Practice Problem 12
* Practice Problem 14
* Practice Problem 16

After you have completed these problems, create a script called `1.R` in your GitHub repository. Print `TRUE` to indicate that you have completed these problems.

### Submitting the assignment

After you complete the problems, *commit* and *push* your answers to GitHub. You can commit your code using the following three commands (replace `<message>` with an actual message):

```
git add --all *.R
git commit -m "<message>"
git push origin master
```

After committing your solutions, make sure they show up properly on GitHub. You don't need to submit anything via Learning Suite for this assignment.

### Checking your assignment

You can use [this site](http://bonsai.byu.edu:9000) to check your code after you have committed it to GitHub. It will tell you whether your code produces output that matches the expected output. Let me know if you encounter any problems as you use this site. **This site is only available from BYU campus.**
