# BIO 365 - Assignment 26

### Introduction

The purpose of this assignment is to give you practice coding in R and to help reinforce your understanding of principal component analysis.

Please go to the `BIO365` Git repository you created for a previous assignment. Create a directory called `Assignment-26`. As you work through this assignment, please put your R scripts in that directory. Read the instructions carefully for each problem listed below. For each of the problems, you should write an R script called `X.R`, but replace `X` with the problem number. For example, for problem 1, the R script would be named `1.R`. **Each of these scripts should load any R libraries that you need and should download data, if applicable. Please do not store any data files in your Git repository.**

### Getting Started

*Please let me know if you see any errors in these problem descriptions or in the expected outputs. Thanks!*

### Problem Descriptions

Please use R code to answer the following.

1. 

### Submitting the assignment

After you complete the problems, *commit* and *push* your answers to GitHub. You can commit your code using the following three commands (replace `<message>` with an actual message):

```
git add --all *.R
git commit -m "<message>"
git push origin master
```

After committing your solutions, make sure they show up properly on GitHub. You don't need to submit anything via Learning Suite for this assignment.

### Checking your assignment

You can use [this site](http://bonsai.byu.edu:9000) to check your code after you have committed it to GitHub. It will tell you whether your code produces output that matches the expected output. Let me know if you encounter any problems as you use this site. **This site is only available from BYU campus.**
