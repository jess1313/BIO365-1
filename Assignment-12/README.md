# BIO 365 - Assignment 12

### Introduction

The purpose of this assignment is to give you practice coding in R and to help reinforce your understanding of probabilities.

Please go to the `BIO365` repository that you created for a previous assignment. Create a directory called `Assignment-12`. As you work through this assignment, please put your R scripts in that directory. Read the instructions carefully for each problem listed below. For each of the problems, you should write an R script called `X.R`, but replace `X` with the problem number. For example, for problem 1, the R script would be named `1.R`.

### Getting Started

*Please let me know if you see any errors in these problem descriptions. Thanks!*

**This repository contains no expected outputs for this assignment.** You just need to print your answers.

### Problem Descriptions

These problems are based on the Assignment Problems from Chapter 5 in *The Analysis of Biological Data - 2nd Edition*.

1. Create an R vector that contains your answers to **Assignment Problems 18a and 18b** from the textbook. This vector should contain two logical values that represent your answers (`TRUE` for "yes" and `FALSE` for "no"). Print this vector.

2. Create an R vector that contains your answers to **Assignment Problems 20a and 20b** from the textbook. This vector should contain two numeric values that represent your answers. Please print your answers and **round your answers to 6 decimal places**. *This one is a bit tricky*. I encourage you to check your answers by doing a simulation in R. Write code to generate vectors that represent strands of DNA and randomly select "nucleotides" from those vectors. (But print your answers based on your theory-based calculation rather than your simulation.)

3. Create an R vector that contains your answers to **Assignment Problems 21a and 21b** from the textbook. Please print your answer vector with numbers rounded to **3 decimal places**. Hint: Use your answer from part A as you calculate your answer to part B.

4. Create an R vector that contains your answers to **Assignment Problems 27a and 27b** from the textbook. Please print your answer vector with numbers **rounded to 4 decimal places**.

5. Create an R vector that contains your answers to **Assignment Problems 31b through 31e** from the textbook. These should be numeric values. Please print your answer vector with numbers **rounded to 2 decimal places**.

6. Create an R vector that contains your answers to **Assignment Problems 34a and 34b** from the textbook. These should be logical values. Please print your answer vector.

7. Create an R vector that contains your answers to **Assignment Problems 34c and 34d** from the textbook. These should be numeric values. Please print your answer vector (**rounded to 4 decimal places**).

8. Print your answer to **Assignment Problem 33** from the textbook (**rounded to 2 decimal places**).

9. Create an R vector that contains your answers to **Assignment Problems 36a through 36d** from the textbook. These should be numeric values. Please print your answer vector (**rounded to 6 decimal places**).

10. Print your answer to **Assignment Problem 37** from the textbook. This should be a numeric value (**rounded to 4 decimal places**). Hint: Use Bayes' theorem to calculate this.

### Submitting the assignment

After you complete the problems, *commit* and *push* your answers to GitHub. You can commit your code using the following three commands (replace `<message>` with an actual message):

```
git add --all *.R
git commit -m "<message>"
git push origin master
```

After committing your solutions, make sure they show up properly on GitHub. You don't need to submit anything via Learning Suite for this assignment.
